This new push is before I update the readme. Right now what i have done is 
created a DS called panel which is holding relised volatility by bucket_idx ( a label that is ordered 0 ... n that internally shows the time_ids chronological ordering) and tock_id on the y axis. The problem is RV is extra noisy because its calculated from WAP (which is normalised because bid ask prices are normalised (nomrlaity is inherited  (I think!!))). So we need to use the denormalised prices to figure out the less noisy time_id neighbours to pick. The Kaggle Recovering_time_id doc fits it to a linear Regressor with CV to determine the features to use in selecting the nearest time_id neighbours with least noise. Instead I'd suggest using Decision tree regressor, cause it capture the nolinear spill overs also. After this we would ideally have to repeat the process of recreating the DS needed for creating the graphs to find nearest stocks. 

! How to constrcut the graphs is to be discussed later!!
